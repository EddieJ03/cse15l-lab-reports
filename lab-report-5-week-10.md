## First Test (File 14)

To find this difference I used the `diff` command on the two `results.txt` files generated from separate running of the bash `for` loop for my `MarkdownParse.java` implementation and the one in the other repository.

For this test my implementation is incorrect. 

Here is my implementation output:

Here is the other implementations output:

Here are the contents of the file:

The expected output thus should be `[/foo]`.

## Second Test (File 516)

To find this difference I used the `diff` command on the two `results.txt` files generated from separate running of the bash `for` loop for my `MarkdownParse.java` implementation and the one in the other repository.

For this test my implementation is correct and the other implementation is incorrect. 

Here is my implementation output:

Here is the other implementations output:

Here are the contents of the file:

The expected output thus should be `[]` since images are not valid links.
